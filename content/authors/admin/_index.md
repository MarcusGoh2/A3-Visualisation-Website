The Indian rhinoceros, also known as the Greater one horned rhinoceros, is a vulnerable species that were once widespread over the Indian sub-continent. Due to poachers, being hunted and for recreational sport, the population of Indian rhinoâ€™s dropped to an all time low of 12 in 1908.  The story of the Indian rhinoceros marks one of the greatest conservation stories of the modern era Thanks to strict protection from Indian and Nepalese conservation authorities, today, the population of Indian rhinos is estimated to be more than 3,700.
